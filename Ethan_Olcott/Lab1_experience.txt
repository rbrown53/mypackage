It has definitely been interesting to use the terminal. It does follow how a lot of coding is but I don't know how comfortable I feel so far having something like this access my files so easily. I am excited to use this for other coding things that I have going on and even putting my homework on GitHub and being able to have easy and consistent access to everything.

All in all pretty helpful although I am still sceptical of it.
